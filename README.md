#  Mykit

Mykit is a personal golang toolkit project. **This project isn't aim to :**

* Provide a general, robust function set for people to use in production directly;
* Guaranteed to be 100% (not even 99%) correct and responsible for the consequences of this project;

Instead, **this project is mainly aim to :** 

* **Share some ideas and good practices** : Almost all of these function codes have been run in production, 
but since these codes are maintained by myself now, they cannot be guaranteed to be 
100% correct, but can be used as a learning resource.

### traceroute
**Traceroute** are computer network diagnostic commands for displaying possible routes 
and measuring transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol network.

In this project, we implement a simple traceroute library which allow us to 
emulate the behavior of the traceroute command on Linux.
